## 🔄 Data Engineering Pipeline

### 1. Kafka Ingestion

OpenStack log files are streamed through Kafka producers into separate topics:

* `openstack-normal1`
* `openstack-normal2`
* `openstack-abnormal`

Kafka metadata is preserved to support traceability and ingestion analysis.

### 2. Bronze Layer

The Bronze layer stores the ingested Kafka records in Delta format.

It preserves:

* Raw log messages
* Kafka topic information
* Partition and offset metadata
* Event identifiers
* Ingestion timestamps
* Original event timestamps
* Source metadata

### 3. Silver Layer

The Silver layer transforms the raw records into structured, analysis-ready data.

Operations include:

* Log parsing
* Data-type standardization
* Timestamp processing
* Duplicate removal
* HTTP status categorization
* Log-level normalization
* Feature extraction
* Anomaly-label integration

### 4. Gold Layer

The Gold layer contains business-ready analytical tables, including:

* `anomaly_summary`
* `daily_summary`
* `feature_engineering_dataset`
* `http_status_summary`
* `log_level_summary`
* `ml_feature_dataset`
* `service_health`
* `service_performance`
* `service_risk_dashboard`
* `topic_summary`

These datasets support dashboard reporting, service monitoring, and machine-learning workflows.

## 🤖 Machine Learning

### Binary Anomaly Detection

The anomaly-detection workflow predicts whether a log event is anomalous.

The process includes:

* Feature preparation
* Missing-value handling
* Class-imbalance handling
* Model training
* Model evaluation
* Model persistence

### Service Health Prediction

The service-health workflow classifies service behavior into semantic health categories:

* **Healthy**
* **Degrading**
* **Critical**

The project uses Spark ML pipelines with:

* Categorical feature indexing
* One-hot encoding
* Numeric feature assembly
* Class weighting
* Model selection through cross-validation

The current supervised training workflow focuses on Healthy and Degrading examples because the available event-level data contains very few Critical examples.

### Early Warning Prediction

An experimental early-warning workflow aggregates service activity hourly and investigates whether the next hour may show increased operational risk.

This component is currently retained as a future enhancement because the available dataset contains very few positive warning examples.

## 📊 Dashboard & AI Intelligence

The platform includes a backend and frontend dashboard that provides:

* Overall log and request KPIs
* Service risk rankings
* Service health information
* Log-level distribution
* Warning and error trends
* HTTP status analysis
* Kafka topic distribution
* Latency and performance insights
* Anomaly information
* Service-level details
* Machine-learning model information
* AI-generated explanations for detected patterns

The backend can query Databricks through the Databricks SQL Connector, while the frontend consumes the dashboard API.

## ⚙️ Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ddevanshii10/Log-Guardian-AI---Data-Engieering-and-Data-Analytics-Project.git
cd Log-Guardian-AI---Data-Engieering-and-Data-Analytics-Project
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

On Windows:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For the backend application:

```powershell
pip install -r "Log Guardian Development/app/requirements.txt"
```

### 4. Configure environment variables

Create a local `.env` file inside:

```text
Log Guardian Development/app/
```

Use `.env.example` as the template.

Required Databricks configuration includes:

```text
DATABRICKS_SERVER_HOSTNAME=
DATABRICKS_HTTP_PATH=
DATABRICKS_TOKEN=
DATABRICKS_CATALOG=log-analytics
```

**Never commit `.env` files, access tokens, passwords, certificates, or private keys.**

### 5. Run the backend

From the project root, use the backend entry point according to the application's configured run command.

The backend exposes dashboard and machine-learning endpoints used by the frontend.

### 6. Open the frontend

Open:

```text
Log Guardian Development/frontend/index.html
```

For full backend integration, serve the frontend through the configured local application workflow.

## 🔐 Security Notes

The repository intentionally excludes sensitive and local-only files, including:

* `.env` files
* Kafka keystores
* Private keys
* Raw log files
* Local virtual environments
* Large archives
* Local Superset configuration

Use environment variables for credentials and secrets.
